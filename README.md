## Quick Start

git clone https://github.com/hemanthpuppala/Chatbot.git
cd Chatbot
```

### 2. Install Requirements

Python 3.7+ is required.
```
pip install streamlit
```

### 3. Run the Chatbot Locally

```
streamlit run app.py

```
- Open the provided local URL in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:8501).

---

## Project Structure

- `app.py` â€” Main application file containing bot logic and Streamlit UI.
- `requirements.txt` â€” Python dependencies (ensure at least `streamlit` is installed).

---

## How It Works

- Enter your message in the Streamlit web interface.
- The chatbot processes the message and returns a response inline.
- Conversation persists as long as the page is open.

---

## Customization

- Edit `app.py` to add your own intents, responses, or connect to APIs/LLMs for advanced conversations.
- The logic is simple to modify or extend for FAQ bots, helpdesk, classroom assistants, or integration with external knowledge sources.

---

## Deployment

- Deploy to Streamlit Community Cloud for free public access:
    - Sign in at https://streamlit.io/cloud, connect your GitHub, and deploy this repo.
- Or run on your own server/VM for private use.
